Implication: More levels (trying part of the path), you will find more artifacts. But less levels, You will get less artifacts but faster time since you are searching for less paths. 

For ex. /applications/username/1/2/3 , if that is path /applications/username/1/2/3  0 levels you find nothing. But if I try 2 levels /1/2/3 without first part it finds the results.

It looks like its taking double time if we traverse up to 2 levels, than zero. If there is 1500 artifacts , for 0 level traverse we are searching 1500 paths. For 2 level traverse we search anywhere between 1500 - 4500 depending on results( for ex. If a/b/c/d returns results, I dont bother searching for b/c/d or c/d).
